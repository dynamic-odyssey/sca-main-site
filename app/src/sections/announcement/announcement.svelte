        <p class="mb-4">
          In light of the recent passing of our former president, Dr. Hage
          Geingob, and the arrangements for the national mourning and public
          holiday, we wish to inform our esteemed Swakopmund Christian Academy
          community of the following schedule adjustments:
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          <strong>School Holiday Period:</strong> The academy will be closed for
          a brief holiday period starting from
          <strong>Friday, 23rd February</strong>, and will extend through to
          <strong>Monday, 26th February</strong>. This break is in respect of
          the funeral and public holiday arrangements made in honor of Dr. Hage
          Geingob.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          <strong>Resumption of Academic Activities:</strong> Classes and all
          school activities will resume as normal on
          <strong>Tuesday, 27th February</strong>. We encourage all students to
          use this time to reflect on the contributions of Dr. Geingob to our
          nation and to spend time with their families.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          We understand the importance of keeping our school community informed
          and appreciate your understanding and cooperation during this period
          of national mourning. Our thoughts and prayers are with the family of
          Dr. Geingob and all those affected by his passing.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          For any queries or further clarification, please feel free to contact
          the school's administrative office. We thank you for your continued
          support and understanding.
