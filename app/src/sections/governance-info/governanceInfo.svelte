                            Strengthen Parent-School Partnership: The Parental
                            Committee seeks to build a strong partnership
                            between parents and the school, recognizing that
                            active parental involvement is crucial for a
                            student's academic and personal growth.

                        <h4>Collaboration with the School Principal:</h4>
                        <p class="mb-3">
                            To strengthen the parent-school partnership, the
                            Parental Committee will work closely with the school
                            principal. The principal will actively participate
                            in association meetings, providing insights,
                            updates, and feedback on school matters. This
                            collaboration will promote transparent and
                            productive communication between the school
                            administration and parents.

                        <h4>Call for Parent Representatives:</h4>
                        <p class="mb-3">
                            We invite enthusiastic and dedicated parents from
                            each grade to volunteer as parent representatives
                            for the Parental Committee. Parent representatives
                            will play a vital role in gathering input from their
                            grade's parents, attending association meetings, and
                            contributing to the decision-making process.
