                  <p style="text-align: justify;">As principal of the Swakopmund Christian Academy, it is my pleasure to
                    share some information about our school. The Swakopmund Christian Academy was established in 1987
                    <u>as a mission school</u> by its founders, with the intention to cater for the academic as well as
                    spiritual needs of the local community children. The objective of our school is to make a world of
                    difference in the individual lives of learners socially, physically, academically as well as
                    spiritually - holistically. This can only come to fruition once each and every learner tackles
                    his/her daily routine with much discipline, attitude, willingness and hard work. To obtain this
                    objective we have a team of vibrant, qualified as well as experienced teaching staff who not only
                    see their work as a mere profession but as a calling. These teachers willingly act as custodians
                    equipped to guide each and every learner to make their dreams a reality. We encourage open
                    communication between parents &amp; school. In this we motivate and nurture this relationship
                    through parent-teacher socials, one-on-one parent meetings and active media engagement through the
                    school's D6 Communicator, and social information sharing via Instagram, Twitter, Facebook etc. The
                    same applies to our staff compliment. All our actions are explicitly streamlined through the
                    school’s mission, vision and faith statements.
                  </p>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;"> </p>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;">The school is fully accredited with the <strong>Namibian Ministry of
                      Education, Arts and Culture</strong> as an educational institution offering schooling from
                    <strong>Pre-School up to Grade 12, </strong>in terms of registration.<strong> In this, the school
                      attained all the rights and privileges to utilize the Namibian National Curriculum. The school is
                      also a member of the regional school cluster and regularly participates in cluster programs when
                      invited. For further enhancement the school has relations with KUMON Educational Japan,
                      Association of Christian Schools International (ACSI), Accelerated Christian Education S.A (ACE)
                      and Accelerated Education Enterprises S.A. (AEE) and makes use of their resources, where
                      applicable, which are developed in Canada, USA, Japan and RSA. This empowers the school to cater
                      for the individual needs of each and every learner, as well as to provide a relative Christian
                      based education foundation for all our learners.</strong>

                  <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Swakopmund Christian Academy has also developed its own unique
                      e-learning (online school) resource engine. Ensuring that learner education continues unabated,
                      uninterrupted, and quality driven. The online school system gives customers numerous academic
                      options based on the learner's aptitude and personal needs. E.g. learners may now register for
                      international subjects based on availability and recommendation.</strong></p>

                      fun walks, excursions, field trips etc. We pre-plan our school's annual science fair as well as
                      entrepreneurial weeks as part of our overall academic planning.</strong></p>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>We have recently established a strong relationship with the
                      Goethe Institute of Namibia through the German Embassy. This allows us to enhance the teaching of
                      the German language in all its facets. By this initiative we have immediate access to relevant
                      resources locally and can therefore cater for the needs of all our learners. We are grateful to
                      the Goethe Institute of Namibia for their willingness to co-operate with the Swakopmund Christian
                      Academy. Our learners were recently invited to a local school in Swakopmund to attend a cultural
                      show by the Goethe Institute of Namibia. Our learners had loads of fun and enjoyed the learning
                      experience.</strong></p>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;">Our current Grade 1 students have completed the Learn-To-Read
                    programme and are building their reading fluency skills.  It is the norm that our learners start
                    reading by April/May of each year. <strong> Remedial specialists</strong> strongly support our
                    reading programme.</p>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;"> </p>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;">Academic success depends largely on a sound reading foundation.  The
                    SCA Foundational phase reading programme has stood the test of time and produces excellent reading
                    proficiency. We very successfully use a phonics teaching approach to reading. </p>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;"> </p>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;">SCA continually assesses reading skills using an assessment tool
                    developed in the United Kingdom.  Our foundational phase students perform near the average when
                    compared to children in the UK.  This is excellent as most SCA students speak English as second or
                    third language.  We are able to identify potential reading problems and provide help early on!</p>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;"> </p>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;">A strong grounding at pre-primary level helps children to tackle their
                    school and adult lives.  SCA has a tried and tested Pre-School programme preparing learners from age
                    3 onwards for Grade 1.</p>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;"> </p>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;">We aim to provide a gentle transition from home to big school focusing
                    on the spiritual, emotional, intellectual and physical needs of each individual child.  An
                    independent Occupational Therapist assesses SCA’s preschoolers for school readiness each year which
                    they successfully attain.  Children are allocated to a just-right group along with low
                    teacher-student ratios to ensure individual attention and maximum growth.</p>

                  <p style="text-align: justify;"> </p>
                  <ul style="text-align: justify;">
                    <li>We follow the <strong>Namibian curriculum</strong> at all levels. Children can therefore
                      transfer easily to any other school in the region or abroad if the need arises. </li>
                    <li>Children are taught in <strong>small group classes</strong> according to their grade level or
                      abilities. They develop the essential problem-solving and inter-personal skills needed for success
                      at school.</li>
                    <li>SCA uses materials developed in <strong>RSA</strong>, <strong>Canada and the USA</strong> to
                      instill a broader worldview and maintain good academic standards.</li>
                    <li>SCA focuses on <strong>developing the character</strong> of learners so that they can take
                      responsibility for their own learning and choices.</li>
                    <li>We strive to maintain a <strong>low teacher:student ratio</strong> with each grade not exceeding
                      15 children. At the lower levels classes may be even smaller, as children need so much more
                      individual attention.</li>
                    <li>We offer <strong>Music Literacy, Arts (Literature, Visual and Performing) and Choral
                        Arts</strong> as part of our academic curriculum, and not as an extramural.</li>
                    <li>Our learners are being trained in the art of choral.</li>
                    <li>Our <strong>Sport programme</strong> is still developing. Currently we offer Soccer and Netball
                      as options to our boys and girls.  Some of our children link in with other local institutions e.g.
                      SFC, or neighboring schools for sports not offered at our school.</li>
                    <li>Our objective is to provide an excellent academic programme based on fundamental Christian
                      principles. The school does not teach nor interfere with denominational doctrine or dogma of any
                      religious organ, as this is the function of the client’s religious organ. Many of our learners are
                      not from Christian families or does not ascribe to any religious organ, but benefit from the many
                      blessings that the school offers. The school does not discriminate or infringe upon anyone’s
                      personal belief or creed.</li>
                    <li>SCA students participate in the latest <strong>Namibian National Standardized Achievement Test
                        (NSAT) </strong>every 2<sup>nd</sup> year to compare its academic standards to other schools.
                      SCA academic standards are on average +30% better than all other Namibian schools. Since SCA uses
                      a variety of teaching systems, we are assured that children receive the essential skills needed to
                      succeed in any school.</li>

                  <p style="text-align: justify;">Our beloved region/country is going through a rough time economically.
                    This has a tremendous effect on our local community more so our school community. It is our duty and
                    mission as a Christian community to unite with each other, to hear each other and to risk getting
                    closer to each other. In the WORDS of our LORD Jesus Christ... <em>“</em><em>My prayer is for them:
                      my prayer is not for the world, but for those whom you have given to me, because they are yours.
                      All mine are yours, and yours are mine and I have glory in them. And now I will be no longer in
                      the world, but they are in the world and I come to you. Holy Father, keep them in your name which
                      you have given to me, so that they may be one even as we are one. While I was with them I kept
                      them safe in your name which you have given to me: I took care of them and not one of them has
                      come to destruction, but only the son of destruction, so that the Writings might come true. And
                      now I come to you; and these things I say in the world so that they may have my joy complete in
                      them. I have given your word to them; and they are hated by the world, because they are not of the
                      world, even as I am not of the world. My prayer is not that you will take them out of the world,
                      but that you will keep them from the Evil One. They are not of the world any more than I am of the
                      world. Make them holy by the true word: your word is the true word. Even as you have sent me into
                      the world, so I have sent them into the world. And for them I make myself holy, so that they may
                      be made truly holy. My prayer is not for them only, but for all who will have faith in me through
                      their word; May they all be one! Even as you, Father, are in me and I am in you, so let them be in
                      us, so that all men may come to have faith that you sent me. And the glory which you have given to
                      me I have given to them, so that they may be one even as we are one; I in them, and you in me, so
                      that they may be made completely one, and so that it may become clear to all men that you have
                      sent me and that they are loved by you as I am loved by you. Father, it is my desire that these
                      whom you have given to me may be by my side where I am, so that they may see my glory which you
                      have given to me, because you had love for me before the world came into being. Father of
                      righteousness, I have knowledge of you, though the world has not; and to these it is clear that
                      you sent me; And I have given to them knowledge of your name, and will give it, so that the love
                      which you have for me may be in them and I in them.”</em> John 17: 9 – 26. Therefore, let us not
                    lose hope for He has promised never to leave nor to forsake us. Hebrews 13:5.</p>
